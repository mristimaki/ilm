## Visual Design

### The Font

I choosed the font for this quiz via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website. I chose the particular font as I wanted a elegant and clean look to the quiz.

### The Colors

When choosing the color theme for this quiz, I looked up the psychological effects of colors and chose accordingly. Green for balance and joy. Yellow and Orange for positivity and confidence.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### The Header

<img width="802" alt="header" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228029447-58bee2f2-32bf-44b3-bdbd-0666274ce97c.png">

I chose a simple design to the header that is consistent troughout the quiz.

#### The Landing Page

<img width="802" alt="landingpage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228029720-d56d6448-267a-4493-883a-5bd10ee42920.png">

The landing page starts with a simple instruction about the quiz and some rules. It also provides the user with a option to start the game with a start quiz-button that takes the user to the first question.

#### The Game Area

<img width="802" alt="quizarea" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228030420-8ff42a6b-0e7a-4b40-9480-349339616c44.png">

The game area is simplistic with queston and three options to choose from. In the bottom of the page, the user can se the current score which increases each time the user gets the right answer. When the user has clicked on one of the options, the game will skip to the next question after one second.

#### The Final Scores Area

<img width="982" alt="resultpage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228336627-09f885f2-4517-46b8-8918-e8c909cffaaa.png">

When the user has answered all the questions, the final scores will appear as well as a Play Again-button that provides the user to play the Quiz one or more times again.


### Feature Ideas
- Instead of just having the green or red color showing if the clicked button was true or false, I would like to add classes to all of the buttons so that it shows more clearly which answers was true or false.

### Other Tools

## Testing
The design of [The Ilm Quiz](https://mristimaki.github.io/ilmQuiz/) is responsive in that way that I have designed it to fit into smaller devices as well as bigger screens. The design stays the same. I've tested all pages both for desktop and mobile via **Lighthouse** tool and got these results:

### Desktop 
<img width="512" alt="lighthouse_desktop" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228337238-6bca577f-c61c-4b92-8ba0-33fa1f913fb0.png">

### Mobile
<img width="512" alt="lighthouse_mobile" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/228337291-b6f2a5e0-ce4c-40d6-bfcc-2081c3a79871.png">

### General testing
- I have tested my code troughout the buildup with the **inspect** tool to see what impact the code made as well as if any errors occures in the console.

### Methods
1. HTML has been validated in the [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
2. CSS has been validated in the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
3. JavaScript has been validated in [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
4. I've used the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) tutorials and references troughout my project if there was anything that I got stuck on or needed to be reminded how to write a certain code. 

### Bugs
- Difficulties displaying the questions and answers. After much testing I finally realized that I didn't need lastElementChild to display the answers of the array, so when I removed that it all worked.
- Difficulties with checking the correct answer, due to the structure of my Q&A array, i needed to get the questions via this code: let correctAnswer = myQuestions[currentQuestion].options.find(element => element.answer === true)
- I firstly had a next button but removed that since it seemed to cause a lot of trouble for my code. I used the setTimeout function instead to automatically skip to the next question once one of the options is clicked.
- Difficulties with adding the correct and incorrect classes to users option, to change into green if correct and red if incorrect. Fixed when I added the classes inside of my displayQuestions function's for loop instead of inside the checkAnswer function.
- I have canged the whole structure of my page several times and at the beginning of the project I started it all over and deleted my first repositry and started from scratch with this repositry instead. It seems that my Questions and Answers array [taken from another code](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Submissions/Quiz-me-Sailor/blob/main/assets/js/script.js) has been a big issue in why things hasn't worked out as they should in my code. 

### Unfixed Bugs
- When script.js is checked in [JSHint](https://jshint.com/), I get warnings about "is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)."
- When script.js is checked in [JSHint](https://jshint.com/), I get "unused variable disableOptions()". But this is targeted from within the index.html with onclick="disableOptions".
- I have tried to add a class style to the Play Again-button but for some reason it does only work to add color and size to text, background colors and so on does not work.
